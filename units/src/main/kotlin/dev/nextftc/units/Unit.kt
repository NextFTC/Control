/**
 * Unit of measurement that defines a quantity, such as grams, meters, or seconds.
 *
 * This is the base class for units. Actual units (such as Grams and Meters) can be found in the
 * Units class.
 *
 * Units can be organized in a hierarchy where each unit has an optional parent unit. The parent
 * chain is automatically traversed to find the base unit - the unit at the root of the hierarchy
 * that has no parent. For example, in a time unit hierarchy:
 * - Days has parent Hours
 * - Hours has parent Minutes
 * - Minutes has parent Seconds
 * - Seconds has no parent (it is the base unit)
 *
 * Conversions between units are automatically composed through the parent chain, so converting from
 * Days to the base unit (Seconds) properly chains through Hours and Minutes.
 *
 * @param U the self-referencing type parameter for type-safe unit operations
